<p><strong>TRIDENT RESIDENCES</strong></p>



<p>An address that&#8217;s hard to forget, the condominium residences come serviced by the unmatched hospitality of Trident Hotels. You&#8217;ll find a level of comfort and elegance balanced with an equal measure of warmth, familiarity, and nostalgia – like that feeling you get when you&#8217;re at home. Residents will enjoy exclusive privileges and premium experiences curated by Trident Hotels, along with a mix of well-appointed amenities such as a state-of-the-art fitness center, resident lounge, children&#8217;s play area, landscaped gardens, landscaped rooftop lounge with screen and seating area, 24 hours security with access control, centralized maintenance, and fire &amp; line safety systems.</p>



<p>Trident Residences is a prized possession for those who appreciate beauty, luxury, and the best of Delhi city. The development sits in a location surrounded by green spaces that are within walking distance of New Delhi&#8217;s major locations. The stunning views from its buildings overlook Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Khan Market, and Lodhi Gardens among many other iconic landmarks.</p>



<p><strong>INTUITIVE DESIGN</strong></p>



<p>An extension of their green surroundings, Trident Residences are designed as pedestrianized realms and raised the ground on V-shaped pilotis. This allows residents to move seamlessly through the property&#8217;s beautiful landscapes. A pedestrian gate allows residents and guests to enter from the street. Vehicles are directed to an automated car park in the basement, with access from the rear of the site. The building&#8217;s architectural language has a distinctive elegance and contemporary minimalism of urban living.</p>



<p><strong>THE LANDSCAPE</strong></p>



<p>The landscaped grounds preserve aged trees inherited with the site, which add a natural palette that celebrates seasonal variations. The perimeter walls of the ground floor are lined with vertical planters to complement the site&#8217;s landscape, purifying the air around its wooden seating decks and pedestrian pathways.</p>



<p><strong>THE INTERIORS</strong></p>



<p>The neutral yet distinct treatment of the interiors provides the ideal setting for residents to personalise their homes with their own furniture, objets d&#8217;art, and artefacts. Each room receives ample natural light and ventilation. The bedrooms, bathrooms, family lounge, kitchen and living room frame uninterrupted views of the stadium&#8217;s landscaped gardens while ensuring privacy for its residents.</p>
